Each group must submit a written report (10–15 pages) following the IEEE format, along
with a 10–12 minute presentation summarizing your findings.
The report must be based on at least four recent peer-reviewed research papers (published
between 2018 and 2024) relevant to your selected topic. Your report should include a critical
evaluation of the proposed solutions, highlighting strengths, limitations, and how these
solutions address specific IoT challenges.

Use of comparison tables, figures, and realworld examples is strongly encouraged to support your analysis.
Submission Deadline: 17/6/2025
This deadline is final and will not be extended under any circumstances. Both the report
and presentation must be submitted via ITC by this date.

Your project must address:

 Overview of the Selected Protocol/Technology. Provide a concise and clear

explanation of the core concept, protocol, or technology. Describe its architecture,

functionality, and relevance in the IoT context.

 Security Challenges or Known Attacks. Discuss the major security threats,

limitations, or attacks associated with the selected domain. Explain why these

challenges are critical in the IoT environment.

 Proposed or Existing Solutions in selected topic from recent research paper in

selected topic domain. Discuss the major security threats, limitations, or attacks

associated with the selected domain. Explain why these challenges are critical in the

IoT environment.

 Recent Research Solutions and Enhancements. Analyse at least four recent peerreviewed research papers (published between 2018–2024). Present the key

contributions of each solution, how it improves security, and how it differs from

conventional approaches.

 Real-world Applications and Future Scope. Explore practical use cases where the

selected solution or technology is implemented (healthcare IoT, smart cities, industrial

IoT). Reflect on future improvements, scalability, and research gaps.

 Comparative Analysis using Tables and Figures. Summarize your findings with

well-organized comparison tables or diagrams that illustrate key differences,

advantages, or performance metrics. Visual elements should enhance clarity and

support your analysis







Zero Trust Architecture in IoT. Analyse how the Zero Trust model applies to
IoT. 
Discuss how identity, micro-segmentation, and continuous verification are
implemented for device-level security.
